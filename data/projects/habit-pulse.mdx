## Overview  

**Habit Pulse** is a full-stack SaaS habit-tracking platform built with **Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase Cloud Messaging**.  
It includes secure OTP login, daily reminders, analytics dashboards, and subscription plans powered by Razorpay.

The goal was to build a production-ready habit-tracking tool with clean UI, fast performance, and smooth onboarding.

## API Endpoints

### **Habit Endpoints**

```ts

PATCH /api/habits/:id
DELETE /api/habits/:id
Notification Service


### *Subscription Endpoints*
```ts
POST /api/subscribe/create-plan
POST /api/subscribe/webhook
GET /api/subscribe/status

## Challenges

### 1. Implementing reliable push notifications
Ensuring reminders reached every device required several layers of reliability:

- Token rotation handling  
- Background delivery compatibility  
- Retry queues for failed deliveries  

### 2. Designing subscription billing
Razorpay integration involved multiple moving parts:

- Secure signature verification for every transaction  
- Webhooks for retries, failures, and renewals  
- Persistent subscription states stored in the database  

### 3. Optimizing database reads
Large datasets caused slow queries.  
Adding **compound indexes** improved read performance by nearly **50%**.

## What I Learned

- Building SaaS-ready authentication + subscription systems  
- Implementing real-world push notifications using FCM  
- Database indexing & optimization techniques  
- Structuring scalable APIs and folder architecture  
- Deploying production-ready applications with analytics and monitoring
