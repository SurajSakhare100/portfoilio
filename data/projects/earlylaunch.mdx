## Overview  

**EarlyLaunch** is a no-code SaaS platform for pre-launch validation and waitlist management.  
It allows makers to quickly test SaaS ideas, collect early signups, and gauge user interest before building the full product.  

The goal was to enable fast idea validation with minimal setup, automated notifications, and analytics.
