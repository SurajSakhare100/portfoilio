## How It Started

I wrote my first line of code in college, curious about how apps were actually built. That small curiosity turned into a habit of breaking things, fixing them, and learning along the way.

## Building Things That Matter

I moved from simple UI screens to full-stack apps, SaaS experiments, and open-source contributions. Every project taught me something—databases, APIs, deployments, and how to ship fast without breaking everything.

## The Turning Point

Launching my first real product showed me how much I enjoy creating tools people actually use. From habit trackers to automation workflows, I focused on building things that solve real problems.

## Today

I work across React, Next.js, Node.js, and cloud tools—building apps, improving systems, and learning new stuff every week. My journey is still in progress, and every project adds a new chapter.

Growth continues, one deploy at a time.
